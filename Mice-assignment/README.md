## Mice Assignment

I got a little carried away with the assignment, and added some user input and while loops to make the code run more smoothly. I came up with 2 questions that when answered were stored as integer variables. These variables then entered an equation resulting in the "3" from the 3 Blind Mice text. In the event the user entered the wrong number, I added a while loop after each question prompting the user for a different response as to make sure the number was always 3. The f"", \n, and \t were super useful and efficient, I will definitely use them a lot in the future.
