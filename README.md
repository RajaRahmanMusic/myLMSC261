## How do you type an "A"?
Paul Ford uses the "simple" task of typing an "A" into a keyboard to help the reader understand a few things. Firstly, that a computer does not "think" the same way us humans do and that there are a few complex tasks being executed very quickly to make the "A" appear on your screen. The computer doesn't know what an "A" or a screen is, so this information must be defined and communicated using binary. There are 3 ways this "A" is represented, as a signal from the keyboard, as it is stored in memory, and the graphic representation on the screen. The code gives the computer the direction it needs to combine these things and create the "A" on your screen in an instant.

## From Hardware to Software
This section explains how digital tech and the tech industry started out very hardware oriented and how it evolved to become more software oriented. Free software-based systems, web-based applications, and commercial app stores all greatly contributed to the downfall of hardware and software being packaged and sold as a singularity. Creating software is still a specialized skill, so despite the paradigm shift in the industry the need for developers still carried on.

## How Does Code Become Software?
To program software one must code. Coding can happen in many different languages. These languages allow us humans to communicate with machines. It turns your code into a list of specific instructions for logic gates, which in turn gives you software. Syntax accuracy is imperative to making sure your code properly runs the instructions.

## What is an Algorithm?
In short, algorithms solve problems, but not all algorithms are created equally. How efficiently an algorithm can solve a problem determines the viability and overall usefulness of the algorithm. A programming language must store algorithms and allow users to store new ones. The DRY principle, don't repeat yourself.

## The Sprint
I've been trying to figure out what this means, but honestly it sounds like someone flaming their boss for not actually doing anything of value.

## Whats With All These Conferences, Anyway?
This section of the article highlights gender inequalities and injustices within the tech industry. Women are vastly under represented and mistreated, and these conferences have evolved to shed light on the situation and have aided in creating a new generation of female programmers.
