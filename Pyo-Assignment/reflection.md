I accidentally downloaded everything before last class because I thought we needed to download and install pyo in order to do the homework. I didn't run into any issues and the instructions were very clear. I didn't like that on the two long installations I couldn't tell if it was actually downloading or not and my computer started to overheat. Overall, I'm excited to see what we can do with this new tool!
